I want to go back to Chengdu after I graduate. I'm Chengdu native, albeit studying and living in Beijing at present.

There is saying which goes,"Chengdu is a city you are reluctant to leave once you come." I grew up in Chengdu and I have fall in love with the city many years. In a sence, Chengdu life style is my life style, relaxed, pace and comfortable. People living here are not under a lot of stress and enjoy their life.

When talking about business, it's really easy to see Chengdu is developed better than any other areas in southwest China.
you can see the economy in Chengdu is highly developed.
