# My favorite city

My favorite city is Chengdu, my hometown.

There is saying which goes, "Chengdu is a city you are reluctant to leave once you come." I grew up in Chengdu and I have fall in love with the city this years. In a sence, Chengdu life style is my life style, relaxed, pace and comfortable. Not only that but everyone in Beijing are always busy and you just feel like another drop in the bucket whereas in Chengdu, people are almost always looked vivid and light and always free to chat or help you out. People living here are not under a lot of stress and enjoy their life.

When talking about business, it's really easy to see Chengdu is developed better than any other areas in southwest China. In 2013, Chengdu's GDP grew 10.2% from a year earlier to RMB 910.89 billion, becoming the largest economy in Sichuan and the second largest economy in central and western China (after Chongqing municipality)[1].You can see the economy in Chengdu is highly developed. Industry, construction and Service play an important role in rapid development.

However, the tradition of Chengdu not only did not disappear but strides on. Nestled among the downtown skyscrapers are two neighborhoods which have been preserved and re-created to represent the streets of old. Souvenir and food stalls alternate with cafes and restaurants in Jin Li and Kuan Xiangzi — even the Starbucks is "old fashioned."[2]

That's my hometown, modern and old, fashionable and traditional, peaceful and lively, spicy and non-spicy.
